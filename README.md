# Face_Recognition
This includes a python code which runs as a web application to detect faces which are saved in the system folder. 
I have prepared it in Visual Studio Code with python extension installed in it. 
The 'images' mentioned in the source code is a folder containing the images of the persons whose faces have to be recognized. 
For making it work various libraries and modules were installed in the system like openCV, face_recognition, os, numpy and streamlit.
'streamlit run face.py' is required to write in terminal for making it run on the browser as web application when asked for, during running and debugging of code.
